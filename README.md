## Assignment Details
The primary objective of this assignment is to immerse ourselves in the intricacies of the pricing platform, gaining a comprehensive understanding of how price performance is managed within the company. With a focus on the range pricing model discussed in class, it's evident that accurately determining target prices for products is paramount for both profitability and compensation.

The pricing team is entrusted with the responsibility of closely monitoring the price performance of products and promptly adjusting target prices based on customer behavior in the market. This necessitates a keen observation of market trends and an agile response to ensure competitiveness. Hence, the task at hand is to develop a swing app that empowers the pricing team within the marketing department to simulate the impact of target prices on product and company profitability.

### Tasks

- Browse Product Price Performance: Analyze the price performance of each product within the supplier's catalog.
- Adjust Target Prices Lower: For products with actual sales below target, lower the target prices accordingly.
- Adjust Target Prices Higher: For products surpassing target sales, increase the target price appropriately.
- Run Simulation: Assess the impact of adjusted prices on company sales revenue. Identify the target adjustments yielding the highest impact.
- Maximize Profit Margins: Continuously refine the simulation until the company's profit margins are optimized.
- Generate Final Product Performance Report: Provide a comprehensive report displaying product revenues alongside target prices before and after adjustments. Include the frequency of sales below and above the target.
- To facilitate this process, it is imperative to generate sales data, including information from at least 5 suppliers, each with 10 products, 10 customers, and 10 orders per product, encompassing varying actual prices. This data will serve as the foundation for running simulations and making informed adjustments to target prices. Furthermore, the management of this data can be efficiently handled through a configuration file.
